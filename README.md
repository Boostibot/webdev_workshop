# webdev_workshop
Webdev workshop for seminar (and my current teaching position) at SUPÅ  Praha.

The main focus is to show what it takes to create a simple but very modern and usable website using html and css. This workshop was for the last year design students.
As such the implementation serves as a reference for the underlaying technology they will be desiggning upon. This is an important piece of information for three main reasons:
  1. Gives the designer a sense of feasibility of their designs
  2. Shows hard limits of what is possible to do with current standard website technology.
  3. Improves their comunication and understanding of the developer side of things. (Having lived through their pains of centering an image). This is especially important for exporting the data in a way that is conveninet for the developer.

The students had no prior knowledge of any sort of coding. This has proven a bit difficult because they struggled a lot with the hard syntax rules of any programming language. However still in just 3 hours we managed to code the header and central portion of the website.
